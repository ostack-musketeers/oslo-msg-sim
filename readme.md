Oslo Messaging Simulator
------------------------

Stress test oslo messaging plugins in darwinian fashion.


Launch a set of daemons in a set of containers with a given set of
roles and then perform message workflows across them.


From juju there are two services, stem and controller. A controller
service which provides for controlling the simulation and instructing
the stems which role they should perform.
